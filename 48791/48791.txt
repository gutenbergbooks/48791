DECEMBER 10, 1998

****This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for December 10, 1998****
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

If you ever take the time to read this Newsletter beginning to the end
. . .this is probably the best time. . .there is a LOT of information,
for both those who just want to get our books, and, also for those who
want to help create those books.


This Newsletter is actually being posted November's first Wednesday in
response to the new United States copyright laws passed just last week
and is thus doing double duty; as the December 10th Newsletter is more
traditionally a venue for releasing some Etexts of the best classics--
which I most often dedicate to my father, who passed away December 10,
9 years ago, just after getting Project Gutenberg's initial supporter,
with one of his brilliant ideas that kept amazing me all of my life!!!

So. . .here is the biggest Project Gutenberg Newsletter of all time...
containing more Etexts than ever before, and, getting us more ahead of
schedule than ever before...with more people to contact about becoming
a Project Gutenberg volunteer than ever before, and even more. . . .

This has been a VERY hectic week, as I came back out of vacation mode,
just a week ago today, having posted only about 5 Etexts in 12 days of
vacation since our previous Newsletter, and in that one week we posted
all 31 Etexts left to complete the next month, as well as the 49 files
of our new, and more complete, AND PUBLIC DOMAIN, Shakespeare edition!
[During the writing of this Newsletter we have posted three more Etext
files for May, 1999, appended at the end of the lists.  We also should
be posting the newly revised copyrighted Shakespeare files any minute.
Sue and Greg may be sending you an independent Newsletter about those.

So. . .please forgive me if I have overdone or underdone anything here
. . .I am already 7 hours late in getting this posted as we speak.

0.  Late news items.

I [Michael Hart] will be hard to reach for the coming month, as I
will be meeting with a number of people, doing conferences, house
hunting in Tacoma, and all that stuff, and, hopefully taking rest
and refuge from everything to prepare to continue the fight for a
reversal of the new copyright laws in court.

So, in addition to emailing me at hart@pobox.com, you should also
cc:

Sue Asscher <asschers@aia.net.au>,
or Greg Newby <gbnewby@ils.unc.edu> if you can't get to Sue

Sue and Greg will be posting the books while I am gone, and maybe
even sending out one of these Newsletters!

Please also be encouraged to contact:


Dianne Bean <beandp@primenet.com>,  United States
David Price <ccx074@ccj.coventry.ac.uk>  England
John Bickers <jbickers@ihug.co.nz>  New Zealand

[But don't feel you can only contact the one who
is closest to you. . . .]

[We don't want Sue and Greg to be too inundated with everything.]
They are not nearly as used to this as are Dianne, David and John,
and I hope you will be as considerate of them all as possible.

Thanks!

Michael

For those who access our sites to get or send Etexts:

archive.org has been through a MAJOR crash as is not,
at least at this moment, fully recovered, so you may
want to try our other sites.  Email Sue and Newby to
find out where to send files if you have trouble.  I
note that sunsite.unc.edu is not accepting files for
the moment because the disk is full. . .more on this
in the Volunteers' Newsletter in a day or so.  Newby
just this minute let me know that archive.org is up,
at least for "outgoing" to send us files, but now it
requires a "cd work" command after FTPing in.  Newby
will try to get the /etext directories running ASAP,
so you can get the normal files from archive.org

[Right. . ."ootgoing" is now "outgoing" [cd work]!!!


1.

As usual, before we even get started, here are requests to
find certain books our volunteers would LOVE to work on:


The works of Francesca Franco [of "Dangerous Beauty" fame]
<cyri@juno.com> Tania


William Blake, The Four Zoas
We have someone who is willing to pay for part of the cost
of getting a copy of this. . .and will proofread.  You can
contact me directly about this one. . . .  If the price is
decent, just go ahead and get it if the copyright is 1922,
or earlier. . .but please don't ship it to me yet. . . .


Burton's Arabian Nights. . .for:
Ron Burkey <rburkey@heads-up.com>
Unabridged, dated before 1923 in
copyright or publication info.

and

Would anyone be interested in collecting up pieces of the Human
Genome to post on Project Gutenberg?  It is often requested.


Here is a list of our Directors of Production, please feel free
to contact them during the next month as I will be hard to get.

2.  While "the cat in the Cat in the Hat hat" is away, will mice play?

I will be hard to reach for the next month, hobnobbing with my fellow
wizards as I tend to do every year at this time.  I hope to come back
with some major support for Project Gutenberg, as I am aging quickly,
and surprised myself quite a bit with our huge rush of production for
the past three months.  It appears we have posted over 267 new files,
with some 216 of them as new editions, all in the past 92 days or so.
In fact, the 36 April Etexts, and all the new and revised Shakespeare
files were posted in the last two weeks. . .someday I hope we can get
that much work done EVERY two weeks!



3.  A first glance at the new copyright laws.

I was only a week ago that the new copyright laws were signed, and it
is my honor to tell you that our volunteers and supporters have great
will power when it comes to a call to arms.  The HUGE book production
over the past two weeks was actually nearly all posted in just 1 week
since this new law took effect.  [I had already gone into what I call
"vacation mode" after sending out the mid-month Newsletter, and, only
4 or 5 new books had been posted between the Newsletter and the law--
when I announce an effort to avenge the passing of the law by posting
as many books as possible for the next Newsletter, which would now be
set for only one week away, instead of six weeks away.

No way I can say NEARLY enough about our volunteers and directors, as
they really and truly CAME THROUGH IN A TIME OF CRISIS to let a world
know that we were not going to knuckle under to the pressure!

A tip of the hat to all of them!!

Now, on the legal matters.

At first glance, the major effect on the Public Domain is destruction
. . .plain and simple. . .for the next 20 years. . .and more, if they
pass another such law, which, I am sure they will try their damnedest
to do. . .THERE WILL BE NO MORE PUBLIC DOMAIN BOOKS IN THE U.S. other
than the ones that had already entered the Public Domain on 1/1/1998.

Even if such a law is NOT passed again and again, the Public Domain a
person might have gotten used to living in this century will only "be
a distant memory before Orwell's Age of 1984" in that a Public Domain
that used to include approximately HALF or 50% of all materials of an
eternity of publishing up to 100 years ago, should now include nearly
0% of the all the materials that will have been published in history,
up to 100 years from now.

Let me put this succinctly:

100 years ago the U.S. Public Domain included about 50% of everything

100 years from now the U.S. Public Domain will include about 0%. .

Here's the simple math:

If copyrighted information doubles every 14 years, and the copyright
usually expires in 14 years, then information is flowing into public
domain access at the same rate it is flowing into copyright. . .so a
quick look tells us that during the time it took to create a world's
new supply of information, the old supply of information came out of
copyright and into the Public Domain. . . .

100 years ago [and up to 1909] the average copyright lasted about 15
years, with most books having 14 years of copyright monopoly and the
copyrights were not renewed, because the books weren't selling after
about 5 years, on the average, for the books that were good enough a
library would have purchased them.  This is still true today. . .you
steal or lose a book over 5 years from a library and the odds are it
cannot be replaced because it has gone out of print.

Since information was doubling just about every 14 years back then--
the result was that half of all information was in the Public Domain
. . .which isn't such a terrible way to have it be. . .the powerful,
the rich, etc., can still have twice as much as those who mostly use
free information.

In my interview last week with the New York Times, the interviewer's
suggestion was that we consider current information to be doubling a
bit faster. . .every 7 years.

If the average copyright were still just over 14 years today, we see
that 75% or 3/4 of all information would still be copyrighted.

The faster information flows through our society, the more is hidden
from the Public Domain by copyrights of the same length.

Under the new copyright law, the average copyright will be nearly an
entire century in length, with no renewals required, and copyrighted
notices are no longer required. . .it will be nearly impossible from
the average person's point of view, to tell whether anything is in a
copyrighted or public domain status, and, it will take some research
to find out. . .this alone is enough to stop most public domain use.

However, even AFTER doing all the copyright research, the struggling
"New Age Public Domain Information Providers" will find that none of
the materials they research will be in the Public Domain. . .none in
the sense that the number will be closer to 0% than to 1%. . .closer
by a HUGE margin to 0% than to 1%.

If the New York Times' estimates of 7 years for information doubling
may be considered at all correct, then this is what will happen in a
United States under the new copyright law, even if we considered 100
percent of current information to the entered into the Public Domain
as an incentive to let this law stand:

0 years. . .100% of today's information is in the Public Domain
7 years. . . 50% of today's information is in the Public Domain
14 years. . . 25% of today's information is in the Public Domain
21 years. . . 12.5% of today's information is in the Public Domain
28 years. . .  6.25% of today's information is in the Public Domain
35 years. . .  3.125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
42 years. . .  1.5625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
49 years. . .  0.78125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
56 years. . .  0.390625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
63 years. . .  0.1953125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
70 years. . .  0.09765625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
77 years. . .  0.048828125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
84 years. . .  0.0244140625% of today's information is in the Public Domain
91 years. . .  0.01220703125% of today's information is in the Public Domain
98 years. . .  0.006103515625% of today's information is in the Public Domain

This is literally just one book out of some 10,000 books that will be
in the Public Domain after about 95 years of a 95 year copyright even
if information does NOT continue to increase faster and faster. . . .

Many people think information is ALREADY doubling faster than 7 years
for each doubling, but all that does is make the total reach 0.00001%
etc., etc., etc.

And you though Big Brother had a thing for monopolizing information.

This is the beginning of

The Information Wars

Since they can no longer stop us from talking to each other via email
or etext or the Web, or FTP, etc., they are passing laws that tell us
we cannot include 99.99% of all the information in the world, because
it is not all protected by copyright.

One last word about the new copyright law. . . .

I plan to be in court as soon as possible as a test case to defeat it
once and for all. . .wish me luck!


4.  The 36 Project Gutenberg Etexts for April, 1999.

We have chosen, with great effort and glee, to present what many call
the greatest epic of all time as our lead story this month. . .in two
separate translations. . .The Odyssey, by Homer.

We are also including more Plato and Socrates, O Henry, H. Rider Haggard, and
B. M. Bower, as well as several more G. K Chestertons, Balzacs, Conrads, etc.
including some of Gaskell's Life of Charlotte Bronte.  We also included a bit
more Mary Roberts Rinehart and Jules Verne.

We hope you enjoy reading these as much as we enjoy bringing them to you.

5.  The 49 NEW Project Gutenberg Complete Works of Shakespeare,
this one is in the Public Domain, at least in the U.S.

Remember:  these are in /etext98, we reserved the slots for them
before we got on the HUGE production run that doubled the Etexts
coming out over the past three months. . .during this period our
volunteers have created about 266 Etext files for you to read.

The revised versions of our OLD Shakespeare are done and will be
announced. . .I just don't have the filenames for them. . .since
we didn't release them as separate files back in 1994, we cannot
just put them in /etext94 as updates to old filenames.  This may
mean they will have to appear as June and July, 1999 Etexts; the
April Etexts are all done, and we may have already started May.

6. The NEWLY REVISED editions of our 100th Etext, the copyrighted
version of Shakespeare's works. . .1,000s of errors corrected!

These will likely be in /etext99, stay tuned for Newsletters from
Sue and Greg about these.

The filenames will be same as above only instead of starting with
a 2 or 3, they will start with 1, and the revision number is 11:

so 2ws0110.txt and .zip are the NEW Public Domain edition of Henry
as listed above in /etect98
and 1ws0111.txt and .zip will be the revised [11] old copyrighted edition
in /etext94 and the new files will be in /etext99

If you have any problems finding these on your own, you can ask
Sue Asscher, listed above, how to find them.  If you are using
an index, don't forget that it takes our indexers quite a while
to get this many etext indexed, so you might want learn how to
use FTP, or the FTP functions in your browers, to get them now.

Remember:  if you get these files directly, without a "point and click"
you will need to go to three different directories:

April will be in /etext99
The NEW Shakespeare will be in /etext98
The revised versions from Etext #100 will be in /etext99
The original version of Etext #100 is still in /etext94
Etext #100 was originally released on December 10, 1993,
for an official release date of January, 1994.
Hard to believe we have posted 1628 Etexts since then,
an average of nearly one Etext per day.  [Literally ~.9]



7.  Who is "the cat in the Cat in the Hat hat," anyway?  Or what?

I am pictured as the 2nd in the list of the Wired 25 for 1998 and
since I don't like having my picture taken, I tend to clown a bit
for the camera to make it more exciting. . .so I am sitting in my
chair in the middle of a country road through the cornfields with
a "long-stemmed American Beauty" between my teeth. . .well you'll
understand when/if you see the picture. . .and I'm wearing my own
trademark red t-shirt with a "Cat in the Hat" hat. . . .

OK, let's make it brief, I often either break into a sweat or may
seem too self-important when these things come up. . . .

First. . .please let me remind you that I probably do less than 1
percent of the work it takes to do Project Gutenberg; maybe less,
when I consider how many Project Gutenberg sites there are that I
don't even know about, and probably never will.

I accept any awards to Project Gutenberg, or myself, on behalf of
all of our volunteers, past, present and future and I forward all
the "Thank You 1Notess" I get, whether via email or snailmail on to
the entire list of volunteers on our listserver.

I tried to get WIRED to give this award to Project Gutenberg as a
whole:  and you probably don't want to hear the whole story about
that. . . .

To make a long story short Wired finally seems to have bought the
tickets to send me to the award banquet to receive "The WIRED 25"
award, for which they commisioned a world famous architect, and I
also get a pair of tennis shoes, a hotel room, and a limo, to and
from LAX. . .I promise to enjoy it all as much as possible in the
honor of all our volunteers.

"THOSE WHO DARE
THE WIRED 25
A SALUTE TO:
DREAMERS,
INVENTORS,
MAVERICKS,
LEADERS"

"Life is short.

"Especially when you're determined to break all the rules."

If you want to read the rest, I suppose I should encourage
you to go out and buy the November issue of Wired. . .it says
THE WIRED 25 right in the middle of the cover, can't miss it.
The first half of my name is obscured by the 25. . . .

IT'S OFFICIAL:  NEW NAME FOR NT 5.0.
The next-gen OS becomes "Windows 2000."
They are trying to get it out before 2000.

MICROSOFT SAYS IT WAS NETSCAPE THAT SUGGESTED A DEAL
In the antitrust suit against Microsoft, Microsoft has introduced a December
1994 e-mail message from Netscape chairman James Clark as evidence that it
was Netscape rather than Microsoft that first suggested an arrangement to
illegally restrain trade.  Clark had written to a Microsoft executive:  "We
have never planned to compete with you.  We want to make this company a
success, but not at Microsoft's expense.  We'd like to work with you.
Working together could be in your self-interest as well as ours.  Depending
on the interest level, you might take an equity position in Netscape, with
the ability to expand the position later."  He added:  "No one in my
organization knows about this message."  A Microsoft attorney yesterday
asked Netscape president James Barksdale of Netscape chairman and cofounder
James Clark:  "Do you regard him as a truthful man?"  Barksdale paused and
then replied:  "I regard him as a salesman."  The Microsoft attorney said:
"I'm not going to touch that." (New York Times 22 Oct 98)


ANOTHER TRY AT FREE NET SERVICE
NetZero Inc. is offering free Internet service to consumers, operating on an
advertising-based business model.  The company isn't selling your typical
banner ad, however.  NetZero's banners can "follow" users from site to site
as they peruse the Web.  The company says it's spent a year developing
software that tracks users' habits, enabling advertisers to pinpoint their
messages more efficiently.  "We can target within a 12-mile radius of where
(a subscriber) lives," says NetZero's CEO.  Idealab Capital Partners, which
is backing the venture, thinks subscribers will like the free access despite
the ads.  "People are spending $21.95 a month for AOL -- that's a lot of
money," says Idealab's managing director.  "We offer a value proposition
that's hard to beat."  (Investor's Business Daily 19 Oct 98)

"GRASSROOTS" LOBBY EFFORT ROOTED AT AT&T
The Prince George's Coalition Against Hidden Taxes, supposedly a grassroots
lobbying effort organized in Maryland, has been revealed to be a massive
effort by AT&T to defeat proposed legislation that would charge a fee of 3%
of gross revenues generated by telecom companies seeking to use public
rights of way to lay cable, string wire, or plant cellular towers to provide
new services.  AT&T considers the legislation unfair because it singles out
telecommunications companies from other users of public land, such as
sanitary commissions and gas & electric companies.  Calling the Coalition's
media campaign a "massive fraud," the Prince George's County chief executive
said, "This isn't any citizens coalition.  This is a bunch of giant
companies trying to profit off the public for free."  (Washington Post 24
Oct 98)

E-BOOKS TO COME SINGING DOWN THE WIRE
Saying that "if you can get to the Web, you can buy a book -- instantly,"
the chief executive of NuvoMedia unveiled his company's paperback-size,
22-ounce $499 electronic Rocket eBook at Barnes & Noble, the bookstore and
publishing company that will make titles available for downloading onto a
personal computer.  Books will sell for $18 to $25, and downloading of a
book will take 2 to 5 minutes.  Tapping a button will allow the reader to
scroll through the book, which will include a built-in dictionary and allow
electronic underlining, note-taking, word search, and font changes.
Generally similar products are being developed by other manufacturers,
including SoftBook Press and Everybook Inc.  (AP 23 Oct 98)

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]




JANUARY 1999


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter of Wednesday, January 6, 1999

[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy


As you may recall from past years, we usually do not send this out the
first Wednesday of the year, so it won't get lost in your mailbox when
you return from the holidays, but this year is just going to be so hot
with potential that I thought we should get a head start.

More about all of the 1999 project and deadlines shortly.

Right now we just need to get more xeroxes in from pre-1923 editions,
so we can get your copyright research done.


We have more interest than ever in getting all languages on line; this
will take an ENORMOUS effort, and we will need some very energetic and
patient volunteers to coordinate these efforts.  We would like to find
at least two or three volunteers willing to be Team Leader for various
language teams we will be forming. . .this is going to take some work!

We will be notifying all those who volunteered to work on Spanish. . !


Here are some examples of other interests:

From:  Leonidas Hatzinikolaou <leonidas@hatzinikolaou.org>
I write to you, Michael, with the following proposal: I'm volunteering
to undertake the task of coordinating a collective effort in my country
to digitally publish Greek books in the public domain, both in the Greek
language and translations of them (wherever they can be found) in
English, under the auspices of the GUTENBERG PROJECT. The formats and
all rules of submissions of the e-texts will be according to the rules
established by the GUTENBERG PROJECT. I will try to spread the message
all over Greece asking for more volunteers to help in our task. I will
check-out the texts, their copyright status, etc. Currently I have a web
site under development (http://www.hatzinikolaou.org), where I can host
the Greek e-texts (which require Greek fonts, etc.), which, of course, I
will forward as soon as I receive them to the GUTENBERG PROJECT.

and. . .

Can we work on a few pieces of art, or more music?

Is it possible to, for example, generate a nice
image of the Mona Lisa?  Or a few more MIDI files
of the great classics?  Maybe some of DaVinci's neat
graphics.

It's not text, but would be nice to spice things
up.  What I don't know about are the copyright problems
for art and how to get a high-rez image....I could
visit France and take my own photos...

For suggested books (I'm not volunteering, but in
case you want ideas to pass on);

Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand
Russell. (1910)

also Newton's Principia (don't know how old an English translation we can
find...

****

And. . .a piece of good news for you who buying new computers:

Current PC sales at the end of 1998:

$1,000 is the current average price--
$800 - $1200 accounts for 67% of all:
1 computer out of 6 costs over $1200:
1 computer out of 6 costs under $800.

And now here are the usual 36 Etexts we provide in each Newsletter. . . .

28 are officially for release in August, 1999, and 8 or 9 more in
June, 1999. . .you MAY want to replace the listing we sent to you
for June two months ago, as it will be easier than pasting in.

LIBRARY REMOVES SOFTWARE FILTERS
Responding to a federal court's ruling that the Loudoun County (VA.)
library's use of software filters to screen out sexually explicit material
on the Internet was unconstitutional (Edupage 24 Nov 98), the Library Board
has removed filters from some of its computers and left them on others;
adults will decide whether they want to use a computer with a filter or one
without, and parents of minors will be asked to sign a statement specifying
whether or not they want their child to have unfiltered Internet access.
Library patron Becky Montcastle-Jones urged the library board to appeal the
court's ruling, saying:  "We have not had pornographic or salacious material
in our library.  Why, just because we have new technology to get to it very
quickly, should we have any different policy?  In the video section, you
can't go in there and get a pornographic movie.  Librarians throughout
history have had to make choices about what will be in the library.  That's
not censorship -- that's choice."  But board member Marc Leepson expressed
the view of 6 out of the 8 board members:  "I'm completely comfortable with
the new policy.  It's constitutional, and it still protects children."
(Washington Post 3 Dec 98)

NBC ACQUIRES PART OF "WOMEN'S CONTENT" SITE
Noting that women "happen to be the fastest-growing element on the
Internet," an executive of the NBC television network has announced it will
promote the iVillage Internet service, which he described as "the leading
women's content site."  NBC, in turn, will receive an ownership stake in
that service, which now also provides information about parenting, families
and health for special sites on Snap -- an ad-supported Web site owned by
NBC and C/NET.  (USA Today 30 Nov 98)

NADER GROUP CHALLENGES AOL-NETSCAPE MERGER
Washington, D.C.-based Consumer Project, a group run by long-time consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, says it will vigorously oppose the merger between
America Online and Netscape.  "We feel this will harm competition in the ISP
market," says director James Love.  "ISPs will have to go to Netscape or
Microsoft for browser software.  They compete against both and if they have
to go to them to get software, it creates all kinds of problems."  Love says
his group plans to ask the Justice Department or the Federal Trade
Commission to nix the merger.  "We don't care if Netscape sells its company
to anybody else but AOL or Microsoft."  (TechWeb 25 Nov 98)

DOD FALSIFIED Y2K DATA BUT HAS "GOOD FEELING" ABOUT FUTURE
A Department of Defense inspector-general report says that the Defense
Special Weapons Agency never conducted required tests on three of five
"mission critical" computer systems it had certified as Y2K-compliant.  The
military officer assigned to correct the agency's Year 2000 problems says he
agrees with the report but that the systems in question will be "100% in
compliance" by April 1999:  "I have a good feeling about Y2K in this
agency."  (USA Today 27-29 Nov 98)

We are hoping to do a Spanish edition of Don Quixote for #2000, but we
need your help.  If you have any old editions of Don Quixote or know a
person or institution that does, please let me know.  We don't need to
scan from the book, but we need one to do our copyright research from!

"Help Wanted:   I am in the process of typing out the collection of Samuel
Adams'  writings gathered by H. A. Cushing (copyrighted 1904) and putting
them on the web.  Unfortunately, I do not own this collection, and must
borrow it through the interlibrary loan.  If anybody who either owns this work
or can get it through your interlibrary loan system is interested in helping
with this project, please contact me at: Regina Azucena <razucena@gis.net>
so that we can coordinate the work.  Also if anyone has access to a scanner
with OCR, this would be especially helpful, since at present I am typing by
hand and the work is rather slow.  The collection preserves the original
spelling of Samuel Adams which is not at all uniform, and this makes the
typing slower.  I would be happy to find out for you if the collection is
available through a library in your area."

E-MAIL RESPONSES AT A SNAIL'S PACE
A recent survey of Fortune 100 companies by e-mail software firm Brightware
shows that many respondents allow e-mail to languish for days before
responding to it.  Four companies took a full week to respond to the
question, "What is your corporate headquarters address?"  (In one case,
Hewlett-Packard took 23 days.)  Rapid responders included Texaco, which
responded within four minutes, and Albertson's and Costco, both of which
responded within five minutes.  Overall, fewer than 15% responded within
three hours, and 26% either did not accept e-mail or made it so difficult to
find e-mail information on their Web sites that a typical user probably
would give up looking.  (Los Angeles Times 18 Jan 99)

INTEL FLIPS SWITCH ON PENTIUM III'S I.D. FEATURE
Responding to concerns by critics that the new Pentium III chip's unique
serial number will allow the monitoring of an individual's moves throughout
cyberspace, Intel has decided to alter the software so that the ID
capability will be turned off unless the customer voluntarily turns it on to
make a secure e-commerce transaction. (The original plan was to have the
feature turned on unless the user took the trouble to turn it off.)  But
privacy advocates are not satisfied, and want the ID feature entirely
disabled.  Deirdre Mulligan of the Center for Democracy and Technology says,
"If everybody's demanding it, it's going to be hard for a consumer to say
no."  (San Jose Mercury News 26 Jan 99)

LINUX USERS WANT THEIR MONEY BACK FROM MICROSOFT
Aficionados of the Linux operating system, which is available for free, say
they will demand their money back for Windows software installed against
their wishes on PCs they buy.  Their demand is based on a Windows licensing
agreement that says that if the purchaser does not agree to the terms and
conditions of use of the Windows software, he or she should promptly contact
manufacturer for instructions on return of the unused product for a refund.
Microsoft says that agreement applies only to the issues surrounding the of
making copies of the software.  (New York Times 25 Jan 99)

JUDGE EXTENDS BAN ON ENFORCEMENT OF CHILD PORN LAW
U.S. District Court Judge Lowell A. Reed has extended his temporary ban on
enforcement of the Child Online Protection Act, and signaled in a lengthy
memorandum that he considers the act an unconstitutional violation of First
Amendment rights of free speech.  To protect children from pornography
transmitted through cyberspace, the federal Child Online Protection Act
requires operators of commercial Web sites offering potentially
objectionable material to establish a system to prevent minors from viewing
that material.  Judge Reed, a Reagan appointee, wrote: "Despite the Court's
personal regret that this preliminary injunction will delay once again the
careful protection of our children, I without hesitation acknowledge the
duty imposed on the Court and the great good such duty serves. Indeed,
perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First Amendment
protections, which they will with age inherit fully, are chipped away in the
name of their protection."  (San Jose Mercury News 2 Feb 99)

ACTING DUMB, OR AT LEAST LEARNING IMPAIRED, GETS THE BIG BUCKS

Last night, Feb. 3, one of the major networks did an expose on
the practice of the residents of Greenwich, Connecticut] which
is perhaps best known as the richest community in the USA], of
having their students get extra funding, extra tutoring, extra
exam time [even on the SATs], by the simple expedient of dumb,
or as it is politically correctly stated, "learning impaired,"
"learning disabled," etc.  In addition to the above, they also
get special entitlement and money for tuition that is cut out
of the budgets for the rest of the students of Connecticut or/
and their regional school districts.  If you have any details,
or corroborations, please let us know, as our information came
from sketchy notes taken from the live evening news broadcast.
Connecticut was/is famous in this area for once having, at the
same time, the highest per capita income AND the lowest amount
spent per student in their public schools, possibly because of
a trend to send all the rich kids to private schools, and then
to refuse to fund the public schools.  This should also have a
corroboration, as I heard it from a Connecticut teacher.

Speaking of corroboration, I received a number of statements a
"modem tax" as many seemed to call ANY fee associated with the
increased phone rates for using modems, never has happened.  I
can tell you from my personal experience that I have been at a
college where their telco actually charged for an entire extra
line wherever any modem was installed.  Apparently, they had a
system that allowed voice ONLY on "normal" lines so the charge
could not be avoided.  Apparently our local telcos have tried,
and failed, to get additional modem charges as well.  But that
note about the national bills for similar things apparently is
a hoax. . .my apologies. . .I got it from someone I have known
for years. . .and who will get an extra copy of this as email.

***

And last, but certainly not least:  for those of you receiving
email from the LIBREF listserver about "Censorship," and "Free
Speech," and a few other related topics. . .the reason you did
not hear more about these is because my remarks, and, so I was
told, those of several others, were. . .how to best put this:

"Censored. . . !"

My own censored remarks were only four lines replying to being
compared to Austin Powers and other similar remarks, in which,
I must say, I showed admirable restraint in NOT replying to an
assortment of comments in bad taste, but only stating that the
truth was that I am proud to be from the 60's, and of what the
people of the 60's did; I won't repeat those simple four lines
here, even if it may be true that their censors don't very far
down toward the bottom of longer messages.  However I will say
that I did resend the note a second time, in response to their
anonymous note saying they were putting an end to a discussion
that had only had a half dozen notes over three days; I resent
[this time a different word than resend] such anonymous notes,
hiding behind the "moderator" login, and complained that their
taste in posting the obviously in bad taste Austin Powers note
was only exceeded by their refusing to post my very short, and
very moderate reply.  BTW, the last time LIBREF hosted message
relays about free speech, the same thing happened, in terms of
anonymous censorship.  When I complained, they posted the note
that had been censored, then, as I recall, still wanted to end
the discussion with me having the last word.  I send them that
famous quote about:

I may not agree with what is being said, but I will defend, to
the death, their right to say it.

They finally decided to let the conversation go on its own and
the result was that it ended soon enough and simply enough w/o
any interference from the "listowners" rather than moderators.

I wonder if we will have to go through all that again. . . .mh

You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]


To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"

The Sea-Hawk,  Captain Blood, or Banner of the Bull, pre-1923 books.
4  New This Month. . .besides the month's Etexts, more Shakespeare of
the apocryphal nature, a new edition Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.


It looks like we are going to need some VERY serious people to help on
doing Etexts in other languages. . .I am not willing to give up on the
other languages. . .but I now realize just how important it is to have
someone who can help coordinate the efforts in other languages. . . .


A.  Don Quixote in Spanish

We are apparently going to need ALL THE HELP WE CAN POSSIBLY GET if we
are going to present this as our 2,000th Etext--if you know anyone who
can help find pre-1923 editions, or who is willing to help proofread--
I don't want to put this off. . .it is too good a choice. . .HELP!!!

***

Don Quixote in Spanish. . .we are not getting very far with this one--
we have only about two more months before we COULD post Etext #2000...
BUT...I am willing to put this off until 1/1/2000 if that's what it is
going to take to get something rolling.  I think it is very important,
more than I can say, to do more Etexts in more languages. . . .



B.  La Tulipe Noire in French

La Tulipe Noire, in French, by Alexandre Dumas. . .we have an Etext in
. . .but it needs some serious proofreading. . .we would LOVE to do an
entire series of Dumas in French and English, and others in French!

It is now possible to get any Gutenberg File via Email.  You simply send a
message to gutenberg@fireantproductions.com with your request in the
subject and the file is sent back as a MIME attachment.  Please note,
however, that your request must follow a specific syntax in order to be
fulfilled properly.  For a complete set of instructions send a message to
gutenberg@fireantproductions.com with the word and only the word "help" in
the subject.  That's help not Help or HELP.  Also, do not include the
quotes.  If you have any questions, feel free to Email
Aaron Cannon <cannona@fireantproductions.com>

Lets say that you want the book Marten Hyde.  Well that book is called
mhyde10.txt and it is in the etext98 directory.  To get via email, simply
send a message to gutenberg@fireantproductions.com with a subject line of
"get etext98 mhyde10.txt" without the quotes.  So your message would look
something like this:

From: you@yoursite.com
To: gutenberg@fireantproductions.com
Subject: get etext98 mhyde10.txt

New this month:


Addition to our recent new releases of Shakespeare:
Jun 1999 Sir John Oldcastle, Shakespeare [Apocryphal]      [1ws5110x.xxx]1788

We have also fixed 1ws2610.* which were accidentally
saved as WordPerfect files rather than in PVASCII.
Those are in /etext97

We have also corrected thousands of errors in Etexts
over the past month or two while things were slowed
down over the holidays.  Of course, with approximately
2,000 Etexts, this represents only an average of a few
errors corrected in each one, but you will find more
corrections in those with filenames with higher numbers.
i.e. xxxxx11.txt will have major corrections from *10.txt
and xxxxxx12.txt will have major corrections from *11.txt,
and so on.  We hope you will continue to send us email of
any errors or suggestions.  We do not ALWAYS change the
version number when we make only a few correction, but
it might be worthwhile to download new copies once a year
or so, or to check the dates on the prairienet.org site
against the dates on your files. . .I don't think the
other sites keep our dates, sorry. . .except that the
.zip files should unzip to the real file dates.

AND VIEWERS FIGHT BACK AGAINST WEB AD OVERLOAD
Meanwhile, Web surfers weary of enduring the "pulsating, candy-colored wave
of advertising that has spread across the Internet," increasingly are
turning to ad-blocking software to speed up their download times.  "They are
a symbol of people saying, 'I'm not going to take it anymore,'" says Jakob
Nielsen, co-founder of the Nielsen-Norman Group.  The ad blockers, which
automatically eliminate all advertising from Web pages, go by names like
WebWasher, InterMute and AtGuard.  Many online advertisers dismiss the trend
toward ad-blocking, noting that when faster connections are available,
consumers will not be so annoyed about being forced to download cumbersome
advertisement files.  "Consumers understand the basic proposition that all
the free things are enabled by advertising," says the chairman of the
Internet Advertising Bureau.  "Advertising is transforming the business
model."  (Los Angeles Times 2 Mar 99)

OPEN UNIVERSITY OFFERS FIRST ONLINE COURSE
Britain's Open University, one of the oldest distance education institutions
in existence, this week launched its first online course -- "You, Your
Computer and the Net."  The course, which is designed for students with
little or no technical knowledge, has attracted 2,000 students, with one
senior O.U. lecturer calling the response "overwhelming."  Participants will
use a dedicated Web site and will have e-mail access to individual tutors.
The O.U. says the new course is aimed at those "who feel apprehensive about
the apparently inexorable march of the new communications technologies."

PREPARE FOR Y2K THE WAY YOU'D PREPARE FOR A THREE-DAY BLOW
Senator Chris Dodd's advice for getting ready for Y2K is:  "What you ought
to do is prepare for a good storm, a hurricane, a storm where you'd like two
or three days of water and canned goods and the like," but you shouldn't
withdraw your money from banks.  A study conducted by Dodd and Senator
Robert Bennett has concluded that there will be no major problems with
regard to the airways, nuclear weapons, or the nation's power grids.  (AP 1

HALF OF U.S. CLASSROOMS ARE NOW WIRED
The Department of Education says that, largely thanks to government
subsidies, 51% of classrooms, school computer and science labs, and school
libraries had Internet connections in the Fall of 1998 (compared to 27% in
1997 and only 3% in 1994).  Smaller and poorer schools are now just as
likely to have Internet connections as larger and wealthier schools.

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]




APRIL 1999


This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter, for Wednesday, April 7, 1999

Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

This month we have Etexts in English, French and Japanese as well as a
few translations into English from the French, German and Greek.  I am
hopeful we can continue even more in a wide variety of languages.

Several new Project Gutenberg sites listed below and more than a whole
month's worth of new Etexts. . .we finished all of November in March--
so we are 8 months ahead of schedule, instead of our usual 1 month.  I
hope we can finish all the December Etexts in the next 28 days. . . .


Lots of things in this Newsletter, not the least of which is that this
month the Newsletter goes out on the last possible day since the first
Wednesday is April 7th, which will gave us a very long month to get up
to completing the November Etexts, but will leave us with less time to
do the December Etexts, a time that is already overloaded with these:

1.  Every April and October we request new volunteers, before everyone
leaves for the summer, and when they are firmly back in the fall.

2.  This year we are creating a support system for new our volunteers,
which will be thoroughly tested this month.  This is a BIG project
and will take some effort to complete.  If you would be willing to
help some of our new volunteers get started, please let me know.
[more below on this, probably the most important thing right now]

3.  We are releasing our first Etext without ASCII characters, and the
hopes are we will be able to interest many of you in looking at an
Etext of Rashomon, in Japanese, as well as in translation.  So far
the translation is not yet complete, but we are working on it.  In
Japanese, it is the first file in the list below.

4.  We are gearing up for our first official public relations effort--
if you can help us get some extra media coverage for Etext #2000--
that would be GREATLY APPRECIATED. . .now is the time to start and
we will continue right through the official release date of #2000.

5.  We will probably have to get incorporated in the year 2000, so the
lawyers who can help us with that will also be very appreciated.

6.  The Visually Impaired Team of Project Gutenberg Volunteers:
Jay Mendham <jmendham@interlog.com>, temporary Team Leader.
This is a team of visually impaired volunteers who create a
set of general Etexts for the Project Gutenberg audience.

7.  The next Project Gutenberg message you are likely to receive
will be a request for volunteers and donations. . .if you do
not want to read it, feel free to just delete it. . . .  The
Volunteers' List will receive one more message beforehand.


From:  webmaster@promo.net [Pietro di Miceli]
There is a new PG Volunteers' Board available at:
http://promo.net/pg/vol/wwwboard/
Please use and peruse it and send me any suggestions,
corrections, etc.
Also see:  http://promo.net/pg/volunteer.html


8.  We are still VERY interested in doing more languages, if you
can do even ONE Etext, however short, in various languages--
this would be more appreciated than you can imagine.

Requests:

For May 16, 1999  [Please forward this to Balzac interests. . . .]

In honor of the bicentennial of the birth of Honore de Balzac (1799 -
- 1850) Project Gutenberg is proud to present English translations of the
entire "Human Comedy." Portraying over two thousand characters and with
immense attention to detail, this massive collection of just under one
hundred novels and shorter works brings to life the social history of France
during the first half of the 19th century.

Team Balzac is seeking a qualifying biography of Honore de Balzac and any
non-Human Comedy works. Except for The Human Comedy and Droll Tales we have
been unable to locate any qualifying editions. If anyone is able to assist,
please email Dagny at dagnyj@hotmail.com

*

From: Michael Pullen <globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com>

Request for assistance/information: Gothic German typeface

I use a scanner to enter raw manuscript material and a software
package for interpreting into e-text. While the software (Visioneer
ProOCR 100) offers a decent German dictionary for spell checking, it
does not recognize the old German scripts called Fraktur. This
moderately ornate and stylized font has gone out of style since 1945,
but many of the older German originals are available ONLY in this
mode. Examples of this style can be viewed on the Internet at the web
site http://www.waldenfont.com/gutenberg2 and many others (use the
word fraktur with your favorite web search engine).

Do you know of, or can suggest, any means of scanning/parsing this
older typeface? If you have any information, please contact the
Gutenberg Project office or myself (globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com).
Your assistance will be greatly appreciated in accelerating several
projects.

*

If you can get a pre-1923 copy of Swiss Family Robinson,
AnneWing@aol.com would either like to borrow it or have
you do some proofing of an Etext she has. . .thanks. mh

*

I have my own personal request. . .someone good with FTP
to help me post books when I am away from my desk.    mh

*

Don Quixote
If anyone is a student at Boston University, their library
system has a 1910-1913 and a 1922-1923 edition which
apparently are circulating, so that would be even better.

*

We need a copy of this because we made an Etext,
then lost contact with the person we sent it to.
Actually we don't really need to HAVE the copy,
if you are willing to do some proofreading.
The Jewel of Seven Stars, by Bram Stoker

1Notess:

You probably already know about this, but I have found Ebay to be a good
source of books older than 1921. I did a search in the book category for
1921 (in titles and descriptions) and found quite a number of books with
a copyright of 1921 (some even with a scan of the copyright page) So you
might suggest to volunteers looking for a cheap book to contribute to
look at http://www.ebay.com

*

About our Webster's Unabridged Dictionary

Some people thought the filenames would be

pgws05*.txt and .zip

however. . .in this case the volunteer added an extra 0, I know not why,
and the location of the number part changed, so the files you want are:

pgw050xz.txt
pgw050tw.txt
pgw050s.txt
pgw050r.txt
pgw050pq.txt
pgw050mo.txt
pgw050il.txt
pgw050fh.txt
pgw050de.txt
pgw050c.txt
pgw050ab.txt
and
readme.web

Sorry for the confusion, will add to next newsletter. . . .

Newer versions just add one. . .next will be 060. . . .

But most start with versions 10, 11, 12, etc.
Only those we know will be "in progress" for
some time before they are up to our standard,
but are too important not to post immediately
get numbers lower than 10, as an indicator of
"not yet ready for prime time."

Not Just Intel and the Pentium III


From Edupage:

MICROSOFT RESPONDS TO PRIVACY ISSUE
Reacting to a controversy started when a programmer in Brookline, Mass.,
discovered Windows 98 generates a unique serial number that is implanted in
every electronic document and that can be used to trace the identity of its
author, Microsoft said it will create a software tool to allow customers to
remove the number, which was created to help support specialists diagnose
problems for customers who call with questions.  Jason Catlett, who lobbies
on privacy issues, says, "This is going to be a cleanup job larger than the
Exxon Valdez oil spill.  There are billions of tattooed documents out
there."  (AP 8 Mar 99)

IBM ACTION ENCOURAGES WEB SITES TO POST CLEAR PRIVACY POLICIES
IBM, which is the second-biggest advertiser on the Internet, has decided to
refrain from advertising on any Web sites that do not post clear policies
explaining to visitors of those sites such things as what information about
them is being collected and how it will be used, sold, or otherwise
disseminated for marketing purposes.  IBM is the first large company to
link advertising and privacy policy in this way.  (Wall Street Journal 31
Mar 99)

Some, if not most, VCR's won't be able to use the programmed advanced
recording feature.  Do not throw away your VCR in the year 2000.  Set
the year on 1972 because the calendar days of the week and month will
be the same as the year 2000.  Please pass this on because it is very
unlikely the manufacturers will not share this information.  They may
want you to buy a new one that is Y2K compliant.

You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are TWO Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers will also want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" list, simply
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]


To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"

unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.

*This is the Project Gutenberg Newsletter for *Wednesday, May 5, 1999*
Etexts Readable By Both Humans and Computers Since Before The Internet
[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

Well, we managed to finish the 1999 Etexts 8 months ahead of schedule,
though it has been a struggle to do 36 Etexts each month of 1999 after
doing 72 a month for the last half of 1998.  This is somewhat replying
to those who have asked why don't we make a more difficult schedule in
the year 2000. . .right now there is no way we could be doing more for
each month than we are. . .we are barely getting the 36 Etexts done in
time for the Newsletter each month, which often gives us a few days of
extra time, which we are glad to take advantage of.

We hope you will take the opportunity to volunteer to do your favorite
book[s] from before 1923, and to look over our new volunteers' site at
promo.net, which should make volunteering much more effortless.  Also,
you can email me and the other Project Gutenberg Directors listed. . .

***Announcement***

May 16, 1799

In honor of the bicentennial of the birth of Honore de Balzac (1799 -
- 1850) Project Gutenberg is proud to present English translations of the
entire "Human Comedy." Portraying over two thousand characters and with
immense attention to detail, this massive collection of just under one
hundred novels and shorter works brings to life the social history of France
during the first half of the 19th century.

Team Balzac is seeking a qualifying biography of Honore de Balzac and any
non-Human Comedy works. Except for The Human Comedy and Droll Tales we have
been unable to locate any qualifying editions. If anyone is able to assist,
please email Dagny at dagnyj@hotmail.com

***Requests***

We have had many requests for Henrik Ibsen, and done
the copyright research for several editions, but we
have never completed any. . .anyone interested??

The University of Adelaide Library, which hosts a mirror
of Project Gutenberg, has added entries to all Etexts to
its online Catalogue. The Catalogue may be accessed by
Telnet or through the Web ... details are at

The Web catalogue (WebPAC) allows the user to download
etexts with a mouse click. Using a keyword search, one can
easily find Etexts by including "Gutenberg" as a key word.

We are interested in finding out if there are people at the University of

interest would be in French and Italian texts and public domain English
translations of these texts. To discuss possibilities, please email me at:

Yes indeed, but for most books I think http://www.abebooks.com/ is a better
bet.  It's certainly a lot simpler than all the auction nonsense, tho'
perhaps not as much fun. . . .

We need a pre-1923 edition of the Velveteen Rabbit,
or one that SAYS in it that it is a reprint of one.

*

Below is a sample from a German play by Goethe, Iphigenie
auf Taurus.  This material in its entirety will be
available shortly and will need a German-speaking
proofreader.  I am requesting a volunteer to take on the
challenge and assist in the final phase of this project.
Kindly contact me (globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com) if you can
offer aid.  Thanks!  Mike Pullen

Verwirrt mu ich gestehn, da ich nicht wei,
Wohin ich meinen Argwohn richten soll.
Sind's die Gefangnen, die auf ihre Flucht
Verstohlen sinnen?  Ist's die Priesterin,
Die ihnen hilft?  Es mehrt sich das Ger|cht:
Das Schiff, das diese beiden hergebracht,
Sei irgend noch in einer Bucht versteckt.
Und jenes Mannes Wahnsinn, diese Weihe,
Der heil'ge Vorwand dieser Zvgrung, rufen
Den Argwohn lauter und die Vorsicht auf.

Es komme schnell die Priesterin herbei!
Dann geht, durchsucht das Ufer scharf und schnell

PAPER GOES ELECTRIC
Researchers at Xerox and at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology have recently developed electronic ink and electronic
paper, which some analysts say may make traditional paper
obsolete.  Electronic paper is easier on the eyes than a computer
screen because it has a higher contrast, and it can display
millions of different images in the same space.  For example,
analysts say that a paper newspaper could easily fit onto
electronic paper, and information could be changed every morning
by deleting yesterday's news and downloading the current news
with no loss of print quality.  Some former MIT students have
already created a company called E Ink, which has developed
electronic ink and paper products and is testing the prototypes
commercially.  The company recently hung an electronic sign in a
Boston department store, where the display is controlled by a
computer from within the store's main office.  These electronic
posters can have text changed instantaneously.
(New Scientist 05/15/99)


DISPUTES AND UNKNOWNS OF ELECTRONIC RIGHTS ROIL THE BOOK INDUSTRY
For all the hype surrounding electronic books, the fast-moving
industry is having trouble convincing the slow-moving book
industry to get on board.  The Authors' Guild mailed warnings to
its 7,500 members last month criticizing current e-book contracts
as bad deals, saying the distribution fees for e-book
manufacturers are payment schemes that would deny publishers and
authors their rewards in the information age.  Other literary
guilds are also advising authors to stay away from e-book
agreements unless they promise to revise the deals when e-books
become more popular. The book industry says it wants to see the
market grow, but wants the terms to be fair.  Current e-book
deals give authors a share of just 4 percent of the book's list
price, compared to 15 percent for traditional book deals.
(New York Times 05/10/99)

COURT SAYS TEMPS DESERVE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
A federal court of appeals has ruled that about 10,000 temporary workers at
Microsoft are entitled to take part in the discounted stock-option plan the
company offers to regular employees. Industry analyst Rob Enderle says,
"This is a broad decision, and it applies to all businesses.  If you've got
a temp worker putting in 20-plus hours a week, you better start considering
him or her like you would a part-time worker" -- and provide employee
benefits.  The ruling indicated that a temporary worker can be considered a
"common-law employee" if the person's work was controlled not by the
placement agency but by the company for which the work was being done.
Microsoft plans to appeal.  (New York Times 14 May 99)

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT WANTS ISPs TO SPY
The European Parliament last Friday passed the Lawful Interception of
Communications council resolution on new technologies -- known as Enfopol --
which requires Internet service providers and telephone companies to provide
law-enforcement agencies with full-time, real-time access to Internet
transmissions, even those traversing along multiple networks.  In addition,
wireless communications providers are required to provide geographical
location information on cell phone users, along with decoding of messages,
if encryption is provided as part of the service.  The European Internet
Service Providers' Association has denounced the resolution.  "Anyone who's
got half a clue about the Internet can easily see the Enfopol proposals are
unfeasible," says the chairman of U.K. ISP Linx. "The problem is it's a
bunch of law-enforcement people who have cooked this up in a vacuum without
public consultation."  He also expressed concerns that the stringent
requirements would prompt Internet users from other countries to route
around Europe, damaging the European telecom industry's revenue.  (TechWeb

PRIVACY PROPOSAL
A Clinton Administration proposal to protect individual financial and
medical records includes a request for more than $5 million to fund an
increase in online surveillance and to train law enforcement officials in
ways to combat security fraud. Congressman Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) explained
the problem to his colleagues by writing:  "Do you believe your banking
transaction experiences are private?  You may be surprised to learn that
with certain exceptions, financial institutions may legally share all of
the information about you and your bank account activity with affiliated
businesses or even third parties." (Washington Post  4 May 99)

PC SALES UP, PROFITS DOWN
Unit sales of PCs rose 21% in April, but revenue declined 2.2% as prices
fell and sales of low-cost PCs surged.  The average sales price of a PC was
$928, according to PC Data Corp.  Sales of sub-$1,000 computers accounted
for 71% of all retail sales.  (Bloomberg News/Los Angeles Times 20 May 99)

About the Project Gutenberg Newsletter:
[Goes out approximately first Wednesday of each month.  But
different relays will get it to you at different times; you
can subscribe directly, just send me email to find out how,
or surf to promo.net/pg to subscribe directly by yourself.]

*

You can subscribe or unsubscribe by yourself to the listservers we
have running. . .if you are trying to unsubscribe, please be aware
that MANY different listservers relay the newsletters from Project
Gutenberg and Ask Dr. Internet, and that it is quite likely you do
not receive our newsletters directly from our listservers.  In any
case of that nature, you would have to deal with the listserver in
question, presuming you still wanted to unsubscribe in that case.

There are now three Project Gutenberg Lists. . .volunteers are two
of them, and the third is for announcments for the general public.
Those of you who want the highest "signal to noise ratio, i.e. the
fewest number of messages containing the most information may want
to subscribe to the "gutvol-l" list AND the "gutnberg" lists; just
by including a second line with "gutvol-l" in place of "gutnberg."
[That is an "-L" after "gutvol" for the Volunteer's Listserver.]--
In addition we have opened an "unmoderated list" called "gutvol-d"
to which anyone may subscribe and post messages. . .we may have to
limit subscriptions to actual volunteers if we start getting spam,
but for now this will be a wide open list.

Rememmber:
"gutnberg" = General Public Announcements
"gutvol-l" = General Private Announcements
"gutvol-d" = Free For All Discussion

To SUBSCRIBE to the Project Gutenberg mailing list, "gutnberg" please
send an email message to: listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu

The subject line of the message will be ignored.  The body of the
message should contain the text:

subscribe gutnberg Your True Name

and/or

subscribe gutvol-l Your True Name

and/or

subscribe gutvol-d Your True Name

So, if your name were Dudley P. Duck, your message would contain:

subscribe gutnberg Dudley P. Duck

You do not need to include your email address, because Listprocessor
gets it from the header of your email message.

Beware that the address must be "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu" You
can't address your message to an address like "listserv" or "listprocessor"
or "majordom"

To UNSUBSCRIBE, just send this message to "listproc@listserv.oit.unc.edu"

unsubscribe gutnberg

If you are having trouble with the list, send a message to
"owner-gutnberg@listserv.oit.unc.edu" and your message will be routed
to the person who manages the list.


Thanks!!

**Help us celebrate by keeping us alive as a continuing institution!**

We have about 50 Etext releases for you in this Newsletter!

With so many entering the Etext field this year, we are one endangered
species I don't think the world can do as well without. . .everyone is
saying they can put a million Etexts online, but none of them actually
have DONE even a thousand. . .they mostly just copy from others. . .as
much as I *LIKE* having our files copied around the world. . .I do NOT
want that to be our undoing. . .if you can help, please read below!!!!

There are nearly 50 new Etexts listed below, all but one produced by a
volunteer corps at Project Gutenberg; you won't find that kind of text
production anywhere else, and we are now in our 29th year of doing it.

*

But First. . .Current Requests for Assistance From Our Volunteers:

1.  We still need PERL writers, and I lost my list of them in the crash.

2.  The 1999 CIA World Factbook should be completed just about now;

I would LIKE to think there is already an Etext of it available,
if anyone can help us find it.

5.  From:   "Whiting, Jenifer" <jenifer.whiting@PTSEM.EDU>
A request for the text "The Flying Inn" by G.K. Chesterton
Most likely found in older editions in UK and Australia,
but any edition that credits its content as originally
from before 1923 will do just fine.  Her copy was stolen,
along with lots of other things, in a car break in. . .mh
[I think we have a copy coming, but this was not confirmed]


6.  I am working on a 4 volume collection of Samuel Adams' writings
(H. A. Cushing, ed., 1904). The collection covers the years 1764-1802.

I would like to thank Richard Fane and Daniel Moore for all their work
getting  volume III done, and half of volume IV.  We can still use several
scanners and especially proofreaders in order to be able to do volumes I
and II.

Even a few pages of proofreading would be helpful.

If you can help, please email me:
Regina Azucena <razucena@netway.com>


7.  The Human Genome Project:  we are going to need volunteers
to help us with this, unless we can find a way to FTP those 24
chromosomes directly into our /etext00 directories. . .*these*
files are large. . .more details below.

[Different Numbering System for Requests than other items]


8. Found an etext of The Golden Bowl by Henry James,
http://www.newpaltz.edu/~hathaway/goldenbowl1.html
If anyone can find a pre-1923 matching paper edition,
then we can post it.


*

1.  More Languages [Japanese, Chinese, Swedish, Danish, DNA. . .more.]

1.  We would LOVE to post one file in a language we have not worked
with before in each of the remaining months of 1999, and perhaps in
2000, if we can.  No matter what format, we are willing to post it,
but would also like to post in the simplest possible format as well
. . .when this is possible.  We may still need help with posting
our Swedish and Danish Bibles. . .just to make sure we haven't
mangled the files.


2.  The Human Genome Project [11% complete at 375 Megabytes]

2.  If you would like to join our Human Genome Project Team,
please email Eliana Brown at one of the following, and cc:me
Eliana Brown <elianab68@yahoo.com><brown12@students.uiuc.edu>
We need help getting them to prairienet.org, and perhaps with
putting the headers on them. . .the files are large. . .and we
don't have an easy internal way to get them there. . .thanks!


We have successfully downloaded our first chromosomes, and the
smallest one we could, the Y chromosome, is 3.5 Megabytes.  We
have reserved 26 slots for June, 2000, for the 24 files and a
few instructions and commentaries on how to read and use them.
This will eventually total some 3.38 Gigabytes, so we could use
some programming help to create a compression program that would
take only 2 bits to store any of the GATC amino acids, and would
unpack them for our readers. . .otherwise this one item will at
least quadruple the size of Project Gutenberg.  Zip is currently
compressing at 70%, I have not tried the higher compression zip
options yet. . . .  However, even if we represented each character
with two bits, it would be hard to get much beyond 75%, unless we
used a particularly good algorithm.  We tried one combination of
our own plus zip and got 77%. . .not sure if worth the hassle.


3.  We need help getting incorporated as a 501 (C) 3, need a lawyer.
[We had a volunteer lawyer, but lost email contact]

This would probably be done in Illinois, and it is obvious we need
to do this, or we won't get the donations required to do more than
our original goal of 10,000 books. . .we are currently doing Etext
at a rate that will reach 3,333 by the end of 2001. . .not bad for
an unincorporated bunch of volunteers whose Executive Director has
not had any paychecks for 6 months and probably won't for the next
6 months, and went through this same situation only two years ago.


4.  We need help getting major grants. . .grant writers needed!

We will get our 10,000 Etexts done, whether we receive any funding
of a major nature or not, but we could do 1,000,000 Etexts in just
20 more years, if we could get some 10 million dollar grants.  The
truth is that if we are going to spend time on other than Etext, I
would prefer that we go all out in this direction.


5.  We need help with Public Relations. . .I lost the address
of our new PR person in the big crash, please email me again!
We have an excellent opportunity to be the cover story on the
Sunday Supplement of a very major newspaper, very shortly.  We
did the preliminary interview last weekend, and we should also
prepare a press release for our 2,000th Etext, Human Genome,
and our new language efforts.  Which reminds me, we may still
need help with Swedish and Danish.

6.  You may want to try our new site at:  www.instinct.org/gutenberg/

7.  From Daniel Meyers:  Here's what I'm ready to offer.
The most up-to-date possible, full texts from Project
Gutenberg on a two CD set for $39.95 (+$5.00 S/H).
Interested parties should send e-mail to
gutenberg@monogames.com and they will be notified
when and where they can order on-line.

Project Gutenberg will receive $34.95 of the above amount.
Major credit cards and checks will be accepted.

8.  We have a new German/Fraktur Team. . .and we need volunteers.
Mike Pullen <globaltraveler5565@yahoo.com>  German and Fraktur Team

9.  We still need help finished up Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
Please contact me if you can find any edition from before 1923.

TO TURN ELECTRONIC PAPER INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCT
Though emphasizing "it won't be on the market in the next year," an
executive of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center says that Xerox and 3M have
signed a manufacturing agreement intended to turn electronic paper into a
commercial product, to be used in such applications as electronic
newspapers capable of adding late-breaking news as you read them.  Like a
computer screen but not much thicker than ordinary paper and almost as
flexible, electronic paper uses "gyricon" display technology developed at
Xerox PARC about ten years ago.  You'll (eventually) be able to write on it
with a wand or stylus or to put it through a computer printer.

"PC AS SIMPLE AS A TOASTER" - THE $199 iToaster
A personal computer called the iToaster (because its developers say it's as
simple to operate as a toaster) will use the BeOS operating system, rather
than Microsoft's Windows.  Priced at $199 (without a monitor) and
manufactured by Microworkz.com in Seattle, the iToaster will offer word
processing, home finance, and Web browsing software, and will have a
graphical interface.  The company is reportedly in talks with America
Online about potential cross-marketing arrangements.  (MSNBC 21 Jun 99,

THE FIGHT OVER INTERNET DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION
Those who want to see the business of domain name registration opened up to
competition will have to wait at least three weeks longer, as tensions
build among the three major players in the discussion.  Those players are:
first, the Clinton Administration; second, Icann (Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers), the organization the Administration created to
assume responsibility for Internet administration;  and, third, Network
Solutions Inc. (NSI), the private company which since 1993 has had  the
exclusive worldwide right to assign all Internet addresses ending  with the
suffixes .com, .net, or .org.  NSI is refusing to sign the contract Icann
has developed, saying it gives more Icann more power than the
Administration had intended;  in particular, NSI is claiming sole ownership
to the rights of its database of more than 5 million registered domain
names.  Commerce Department staffer Becky Burr is optimistic that the
dispute will be resolved soon: "I believe it is in everybody's best
interest not to swing threats around."  In the meantime, Icann interim
president Mike Roberts notes, "It's great political theater."  (New York
Times 28 Jun 99)

IS THERE A SHORTAGE OF INFO TECH PROFESSIONALS?
A survey conducted on the Web site of Computer magazine to determine
attitudes about the shortage of information technology professionals found
that 54% of the 84 respondents believe that such a shortage indeed exists
and that liberal immigration policies are generally a good idea;  36% deny
that there's a shortage, and are convinced that corporate America is simply
claiming one so that it can import less expensive workers instead of
investing in the U.S. workforce.  The rest of the respondents say that the
global economy has created a new and complex problem which requires new
kinds of solutions.  (Computer May/Jun 99)

"WHO WANTS TO KNOW?"  (CUSTOMIZED HISTORY FROM ENCARTA)
Today's Wall Street Journal reports that the nine different editions of
Microsoft's Encarta multimedia encyclopedia sometimes give different
answers to the same question.  For example, the U.S., U.K, and German
editions say the inventor of the telephone was Alexander Graham Bell,
whereas the Italian version says the inventor was the impoverished
Italian-American candle maker Antonio Meucci.  Other editions vary on who
invented the electric light bulb, who discovered the virus that causes
AIDS, and other such things.  Microsoft says its editorial teams are made
up of local experts, and company chief executive Bill Gates argued in 1997:
"In the long run, exposing people to worldwide perspectives should be
healthy.  Americans benefit from a better understanding of the Asian or
European view of important cultural and scientific events, and vice versa."

TRACKING ANONYMOUS SPAM
If you hate getting all those "Make Money Fast At Home!!!" messages from
people who use hard-to-trace or false return addresses, you might want to
use the services of www.spamcop.net, a Web site that allows you to take
action against unsolicited junk e-mail messages sent out in bulk
quantities.  Spam Cop is able to dissect the header information on such

THREE WEEK DELAY IN OPENING UP INTERNET NAME REGISTRATION
The process to open the registration of Internet domain names to
competition has been delayed three weeks due to continued
tensions between the Clinton administration, monopoly-holder
Network Solutions, and would-be overseer ICANN.  Many have
accused ICANN of abusing its power, particularly by holding
closed meetings and by assigning a $1 annual fee to every domain
name registered.  Many were also angered by ICANN's threat to
terminate Network Solutions' authority to register new Internet
addresses, although ICANN has since admitted that only the
Commerce Department holds that authority.  Government officials
such as Virginia's Representative Thomas J. Bliley and Governor
James Gilmore, as well as lobbyists on behalf of Network
Solutions, have demanded investigations into the process of
choosing board members and ICANN's authority to charge the $1
fee.  Other major issues to be resolved include the question of
ownership regarding Network Solutions' user database, the terms
of ICANN's authority, and the prices that businesses must pay
Network Systems to administer the central registry.

TEXTBOOK PUBLISHER LAYS PLANS FOR AN INTERNET UNIVERSITY
Academic publishing house Harcourt General is joining the growing
business of distance education.  It plans to expand its online
offerings with three ventures:  Harcourt University; an Internet
high school for students planning to take high-school equivalency
exams; and an e-commerce site called Harcourt.com.  Through its
university, Harcourt may become the first major publishing house
to offer accredited college degrees, pending approval from the
New England Association of Schools and Colleges.  Yet Harcourt
faces much opposition, particularly from college professors
concerned that Internet-based education denies students the
personal interaction central to a traditional learning
experience.  University bookstores and other traditional
distributors may also oppose the venture because it competes with
their sales.  Last, Harcourt will face strong competition from
the companies and universities already providing online courses.
Harcourt maintains that its educational offerings will be unique.
Its university, which may begin to offer courses by September
2000, will teach a range of subjects in arts and sciences.

U.S. EASES RESTRICTIONS ON SELLING FAST PCS TO RUSSIA AND CHINA
President Clinton significantly reduced restrictions on exports
of powerful computers, arguing that technological innovations
have made laptop and desktop PCs as powerful as the
supercomputers produced just a few years ago.  Previously,
companies were required to obtain individual export licenses to
ship computers faster than 10,000 Mtops (Millions of theoretical
operations per second) to a group of countries which include most
of South America, South Korea, South Africa, and much of Southeast
Asia, but Clinton's order increased the limit to 20,000 Mtops.
The old laws also required companies shipping to a category of
countries deemed "proliferation risks" -- such as China and
Russia -- to obtain licenses to ship any computer faster than
2,000 Mtops to military users or 7,000 Mtops for civilian users.
In contrast, Intel's Pentium III chip is rated at about 1,300
Mtops, and versions due out later this year will hit about 2,000
Mtops.  (New York Times 07/02/99)


Y2K SCARE LEADS TO LARGER ADVANCES [I think this is just to
counter the fact that most people will NOT buy computers now,
and for the next 6 months, until the bug date has passed. . .
which will mean HUGE losses for the economy. . . .  mh]

Experts say the Y2K bug may actually benefit companies and the
economy in general, as it forced many firms to completely
overhaul their computer systems and re-engineer their business
processes to become more efficient.  Federal Reserve Governor
Alan Greenspan noted in his June 1 congressional testimony that
the American economy "is displaying a remarkable run of economic
growth that appears to have its roots in ongoing advances in
technology," and many experts say the Y2K bug is to blame.  The
millennium bug gave senior management an urgent deadline for
assessing their computer systems as well as their entire business
processes, resulting in "a dramatic surge in buying" of ERP
systems, which reorganize and integrate a firm's accounting and
other business practices.  Thus many companies' antiquated
business operations have been modernized, merged, and streamlined
to prepare for Y2K, producing benefits such as increased
productivity, improved customer responsiveness, reduced
inventory, and increased efficiency.

U.S. TO MARKET INFO-TECH WORK TO TEENS  [This seesm to be more
PR aimed at "growing the economy" at the expense of the workers.
I know lots of people in this field, and I'm not sure ANY of the
people I hang out with on a daily basis are actually making the
$68,000 "average" salary mentioned in an earlier one of these.
However, it doesn't take too many Bill Gates to up the "average"
beyond any useful meaning. . .perhaps "median" would be better.]

The Department of Commerce next year is planning to launch a
major advertising campaign to convince teenagers to choose a
career in information technology.  The marketing campaign is
intended to help ease the shortage of high-tech workers by
convincing teenagers that computers are "cool" and  to dispel the
"negative 'geek' or 'nerd' stereotype of technical workers,"
according to Commerce Secretary William Daley.  Analysts estimate
that the U.S. tech industry will need more than 1.3 million tech
workers between 1996 and 2000, with California, Texas, and
Virginia being areas that will need workers the most. Among the
steps the Department advises to ease the shortage are forging
closer links between schools and tech companies, improving
methods of teaching math and science in high schools, and
increasing pay for teachers in those fields, and giving tech
workers incentives to fill teaching positions and train older
workers.  (Washington Post 07/01/99)

But are there really the texts of entire books?
Is it possible?  If yes, it must have been hard work - my admiration!

Keep up your great work.  :)

This is truly one of the greatest things on the net.  I go there all the
time to download and read my favorites.  Thank you so much and yes,
I am one of your fans.

PG has been one of, if not THE, the greatest aids to 'legitimizing'
electronic book publishing of new works.  Without your work to make
classic literature available in electronic format, we'd have a LOT
more difficulty with "But that's not a REAL book" than we do.

You have a LOT of fans here.  PG is one of the greatest things
on the net since the inception of the net.  We can all
only hope to make a large a contribution as you have.

I wish to thank all who have been, or are working on Project Gutenberg
for compiling so many interesting books.  They enable me, a student with
limited financial means to read books that cannot be obtained otherwise.

This is a GREAT! project! I only regret that I just discovered it.
[All the more reason we need to work on getting better PR--HELP!]

I can only thank everyone who've put in the hard work to make
those books available on PG.  In fact, I've read so many. . . .

Most recent read I did was last month, of the Gutenberg version
of "The Insidious Dr Fu Manchu", a fiction novel.

Thanks gang, for all the excellent and invaluable work!

I have read several classics from cover to cover on my trusty
Sharp laptop in the past year. Including PG's Pride and
Prejudice and Villette (I think that was PG)

What Michael Hart and other public domain people are doing is a
work of unprecedented philanthropy: a direct acceleration of
the democratisation of knowledge. They are to be applauded.

All the best, and thanks for all the wonderful
work you have been doing on the project. . . .

As always, please add my thanks to the list...

New Files

We have a very interesting collection of Etext for you this August.

First, two new languages are introduced, Swedish and Danish, and an
introduction to Etext from Project Runeberg, the very first Project
Project Gutenberg spin-off, which started 7 years ago.  Why did the
introduction take so long, as with the Gutenberg Projekt-DE [we are
also going to introduce you to them] many Etext projects wanted the
opportunity to make it on their own. . .which we were glad to have,
until things had gotten strongly underway.  So we decided to wait a
while, at least until our own Project Gutenberg effort had made the
leap to one or two thousand Etexts of our own.  So, now, in efforts
to create a wider availability of languages on the Internet, we are
cooperating with Project Runeberg, the Gutenberg Projekt-DE and the
other Etext operations working in the public domain, to bring wider
language selections to a wider audience around the world.  I didn't
realize that it was not obvious that downloading from European site
locations was very difficult for persons in South Africa, and South
America, Australia, New Zealand, etc. . .or I would have made a big
effort to make this more obvious to everyone sooner.  This fact was
a big part in securing the cooperation of the other projects, along
with the fact that we are happy give full credit, list URLs and all
other contact information for those who create these Etexts.  We do
not have this information for the Danish Bible, if you can help....

[Yes, there is a double negative three sentences up. . .mh]

In addition to Swedish and Danish, we are also continuing with some
German Etexts, including those from our own volunteers. . .Goethe's
Egmont is available this month, and hopefully at least one Etext in
German each month to come, perhaps two. . .one of our own, plus one
from Projekt Gutenberg-DE.

We also continue our series of Human Genome Project chromosomes, to
include 6 more. . .for a total of 12 of the 24 human chromosomes; I
should add that we have chosen the shortest of the 24 files, to get
things going as easily as possible.  The last one is 50 megabytes!!
And these only add up to about 11% of the whole thing, so if you do
want these, the total will eventually be 3.3G.

In addition, we have two more volumes of our Friedrich series; that
now brings our total to 10 of the 21 volumes by Carlyle.

To bring the introduction to a close, we have Thomas More's Utopia,
along with a few dozen other Etexts you will see listed below.

Due to the way we have indexed these for future convenience, we are
including [all from the year 2000] 6 Etexts from June, 25 of April,
and 12 from March. . .yes, we usually do post a few more than 36 as
the Newsletter comes out on the first Wednesday of the month, so we
have a few days of work from the next month, which I feel we should
include, rather than make you wait an additional month.

I should add a few comments about using http ["The Web"] versus ftp
["The Net"]. . .if you use http, then you have to wait for a "human
being" to index the files for that Web Site. . .unless they have an
automated indexing system, which is usually not the case. . .but if
you use ftp [which you can now do from most Web Browsers, you don't
have to wait for such an index to be built.  However, these indices
are often very valuable in searching for what you want, so I should
strongly recommend you use them when, other then when searching for
the very latest Etexts. . .the indices usually contain everything I
have posted, other than from the most recent Newsletter.  If you do
want to use ftp, keep this Newsletter's contents on file so you can
recognize which filenames you want to get.

AOL TO MICROSOFT:  SORRY, BUT IT'S A PRIVATE PARTY
America Online is trying to block attempts by Microsoft's new MSN Messenger
Service to let Microsoft customers exchange messages instantly with AOL's
community of users. Charging  Microsoft with trespassing on its system, AOL
has erected several software barriers to Microsoft's efforts, prompting
Microsoft to respond to each obstruction by developing an immediate
software workaround.  Forrester Research analyst Tom Rhinelander sees the
argument as "kind of like a food fight, like a couple of juveniles saying
'You can't do this,' 'Yes I can,' 'You can't do this,' 'Yes I can.' ...
AOL will say 'we've got to be careful about security and scalability,' and
all these kinds of things.  But they'll be forced to open up to the other
folks, there's no way around it."  (San Jose Mercury News 27 Jul 99)

INTERNET FEVER SPREADS TO BRITAIN
With British ISP Freeserve PLC enjoying a 37% stock price increase on the
first day of public trading, Britain.is getting its first experience of the
wild Internet success stories now common in the U.S.  Freeserve, which is
now the largest access provider in Britain, developed a business model that
gives customers free access -- and derives its revenue exclusively by
taking a share of phone revenue generated by the cost of the telephone
calls users place to Freeserve.   Unlike the U.S., where phone customers in
most parts of the country can make unlimited local calls for a flat monthly
charge, European phone companies (at least for the present!) charge by
minutes of connect time.  (New York Times 27 Jul 99)

RUSSIAN ISP SAYS "NYET" TO SPYING
Russian Internet service provider Bayard-Slavia is refusing to obey a
directive that gives the country's Federal Security Service (FSB) the right
to examine private e-mail messages without a warrant.  The System of
Efficient Research Measures 2directive also requires ISPs to pay for
surveillance equipment in their servers and for a link to FSB headquarters.
In retaliation for Bayard-Slavia's recalcitrance, the FSB has withdrawn the
ISP's license, frozen its bank account, and is challenging its right to
frequencies for its satellite link to Moscow.  "We will never help the FSB
implement illegal shadowing," says Bayard-Slavia's director general.  "We're
the first ISP to struggle against illegal information collection.
Unfortunately, we're also likely to become the first to be destroyed because
of insubordination."  (Data Communications 26 Jul 99)

INTERNET RIVALS ATTEMPT TO OPEN UP AOL'S INSTANT MESSAGE SYSTEM
A number of Internet service providers aim to establish open
access to America Online's exclusive instant messaging programs.
Instant messaging notifies users when their friends are online
and allows them to type messages to each other.  It is an
increasingly popular form of communication, and with three
services and a total 80 million users, AOL dominates the market.
Yet Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Prodigy each attempted to change this
recently by creating rival services that can communicate with
users of AOL's services.  AOL responded to this threat by
changing its communications protocols, effectively eliminating
the rival programs' access to its service.  While Microsoft has
been able to adjust its software to access AOL, Yahoo! and
Prodigy have not.  The three contend that AOL should open its
technology to facilitate interaction between users of all
services.  Yet AOL argues that because access to its services
was unauthorized, the rival services have breached accepted
security standards.  (Wall Street Journal 07/26/99)

Comments on Our Schedule

A number of people have asked about our current schedule...

My apologies for jumping so far into the future for some of
the files we are currently working on, but putting them all
in a single block in the index really makes it much easier,
for us, and also for those using the raw index I produce in
the first week of each month, relating the postings, events
and other comments from the previous month.

The quick answers:

1.  We are currently about 8 months ahead of our schedule.

2.  We are currently just barely making our schedule of 36
Etexts per month. . .so we can't increase scheduling.

3.  We reserved space in March, 2000 for a 21 volume set,
of which we have now completed 11 volumes.  We also
reserved space in June, 2000, for Human Genome files,
of which we have now complete 18 chromosomes, but this
leaves some gaps still to be filled. . .we have just
finished all the April, 2000, Etexts, and started on
May. . .all of which you will see indexed below.  If
possible, I will sneak in the last 6 chromosomes for
this Newsletter, but it will be very close. . .they
are big files, and the person who helps me with them
is unavailable at the moment.

The more detailed answers:

Our current official schedule is to do 36 Etext per month--
I am TRYING to do 40 per month--but it is a tough go at the
moment, with so many of our academic people having been out
for the summer, and not really back in the saddle yet. . .I
am therefore officially sticking to the 36 Etexts per month
schedule, but doing my best to really make it average 40.

If we CAN average 40, we will reach 3,333 Etexts by the end
of 2001. . . .  We were going to try to double production--
every year--but without and serious Public Relations effort
or funding effort, we have still survived, but not expanded
our production much from the 32 Etexts per month we did for
several years. . .this is still more than anyone else but I
do hope can eventually move to 72 per month, and then more.

But this will take some serious PR and financial grant work
. . .if ANY of you are interested, please let me know.

Now. . .having said ALL that. . .we somehow managed a great
deal of extra production during the last 6 months last year
. . .no one seems to have any idea why. . .but we actually,
really did manage to average 72 Etext per month then, so we
ended up about 8 months ahead of schedule. . .since we were
about a month or two ahead when we started that period. . .
we have never quite figured out what happened, and we can't
really change our schedule without the premise that this is
actually possible on a continuing basis, without additional
resources. . .so it is just one of those little mysteries--
and a very nice one to have had.

So. . .we started this year about 7-8 months ahead. . .this
is why we started the Etexts for the year 2000 a few months
ago. . . .  If we manage an extra 4 Etext per month for the
first 9 months or a bit longer we will end up with one more
month done ahead of schedule. . .but even with the 24 files
of the Human Genome Project going in right now, it looks as
if we will have to work pretty hard to achieve that goal.

NAVY OFFICIALS BACK OFF DIRE Y2K FORECAST  [Under Duress]
The Navy issued a statement denying its earlier reports of
expected power failures resulting from the year 2000 (Y2K)
computer bug for nearly 60 Navy and Marine Corps installations.
The first Navy report found the probable and likely failure of
natural gas, electricity, water and sewer utility services in
communities near the installations.  The Navy retracted the
statement, saying it now agrees with the White House assessment,
which states electrical failures will be unlikely in the new
year.  Meanwhile, the Navy has not yet completed verifying Y2K
computer readiness for various Navy and Marine Corps communities.
The Navy posted its original findings on the Internet, but
removed them due to inaccurate and misleading information.  Navy
officials say the database will be put back on the Internet,
accompanied with text explaining the findings.
(Washington Post 08/21/99)

[Here is the original report]

NAVY Y2K REPORT PREDICTS 'LIKELY' UTILITY OUTAGES IN SEVERAL CITIES
A recent updated Navy report predicts that electric utilities
serving nearly 60 of the approximately 400 Navy and Marine
facilities will probably suffer a power outage due to the year
2000 (Y2K) computer bug.  The military report also expected power
failures in several cities, including Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale,
Fla.; as well as some midwinter natural gas failures in such
places as Fort Worth, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; and Albany, N.Y.
The Navy report is in sharp contrast to other predictions,
including conclusions from the White House.  John
Koskinen--President Clinton's top Y2K advisor--said the Navy's
results were overly cautious and were based on the worst-case
scenario.  (Washington Post 08/20/99)

WIRED ON CAMPUS E-LIFE
Many students are beginning to pick universities based on how
"wired" they are, according to a recent article in USA Today.
This is because students are performing more functions online,
from registering for classes and communicating with professors to
ordering take-out, than ever before.  Of the 15 million students
currently attending a college, 60 percent say they go online
daily, and 85 percent of students own their own computers,
according to research firm Student Monitor.  The company predicts
that university students will spend $700 million online during
the next school year, and over $4 billion online annually by
2002.  (USA Today 08/19/99)

MICROSOFT-AOL WAR HEATS UP OVER NET ACCESS
Though America Online is on top of the online service provider
heap right now, Microsoft is aiming to knock it from its perch.
While AOL continues to charge for its service, Microsoft wishes
to move the market towards free or cheap access.  The company has
tested a $9.95 price point for monthly access fees, and is
mulling over the idea of giving free access to consumers who
agree to spend a certain amount each month with some of
Microsoft's e-commerce partners.  For its part, AOL says that
Microsoft's attempts to undercut monthly charges will ultimately
not be successful, as even deep-pocketed Microsoft cannot afford
to lose money on Internet access forever.  Meanwhile, Microsoft
says its moves against AOL are protective in nature, believing
that in the near future AOL is planning to become an online
software platform to rival Microsoft's Windows.

ALTAVISTA OFFERING FREE INTERNET ACCESS
AltaVista Thursday launched a free Internet access service,
becoming the first major Internet site to do so.  The company,
which owns one of the Web's 10 most visited sites, hopes to
attract more customers by providing free Internet access.
Although AltaVista will lose subscription revenues, the company
believes increased ad revenues will compensate for the loss.
AltaVista users will be required to begin their Web surfing from
the AltaVista home page, and will have an ad constantly in the
corner of their computer screens.  In addition, a MicroPortal
will appear on the screen that contains banner ads as well as
links to shopping and search sites.  Although AltaVista will not
sell consumer registration information, it will use the data to
customize ads to a user's interests, says AltaVista spokesperson
David Emmanuel.  (USA Today 08/13/99)

CLEVELAND FREE-NET CLOSES DOWN
Cleveland Free-Net, which was the nation's first free community computer
network, will shut down this Fall rather go through the effort and expense
of reprogramming the system to make it Y2K-compliant. One long-time user of
the Free-Net, which started in 1984 as an electronic bulletin board at Case
Western Reserve University, said:  "It's just sad to see it go.  It's an
institution."  (AP/San Jose Mercury News 5 Aug 99)

CRYPTOGRAPHER DESIGNS SUPER-CODE-CRACKING COMPUTER
Cryptographer Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel has
designed a computer that uses light-emitting diode technology to crack
512-bit encryption keys in just two or three days.  A recent effort to crack
465-bit keys took hundreds of computers and several months.  Twinkle, which
stands for The Weizmann Institute Key Locating Engine, measures the light
from the diodes to perform the mathematical calculations necessary to
decrypt the keys.  The computer, if built, would cost about $2 million, and
could jeopardize the security of the majority of electronic commerce
underway today.  Longer keys, with 1,024-bits, are now used for highly
sensitive documents, but the most popular browsers used for transactions
today are set for only 512 bits.  (Wall Street Journal 16 Aug 99)

TIPTOEING THROUGH THE WEB
Privada Inc. of San Jose, Calif., is offering a new service that allows
users to make all of their Internet activities - e-mail, online chats, Web
browsing and e-commerce transactions - completely anonymous.  The Web
Incognito service encrypts the data flowing from the subscriber's Internet
service provider and masks its origins before sending it on to its intended
destination.  The service, which can be switched on and off by the user,
also stores the subscriber's "cookies."  Web Incognito differentiates itself
from other privacy products in that it covers all Internet activities - not
just Web browsing or e-mail - and has said it will share the identity of
users with law enforcement authorities who have appropriate warrants.  "Our
service is for protecting the privacy of consumers, not for hiding criminals
or criminal activities," says Privada CEO Barbara Bellissimo.  "We felt it
would be irresponsible not to give law enforcement agencies the information
if they have valid warrants."  (New York Times 16 Aug 99)

BROADCOM'S 10-IN-1 NETWORKING CHIP
Broadcom Corp. has developed a new networking chip that can perform tasks
now handled by up to 10 separate chips.  The StrataSwitch chip boasts 60
million transistors and is capable of analyzing the content of data
transmissions and assigning higher priority to those packets containing
voice and video.  "What this represents is basically the world's first true
switching system on a single chip," says the general manager of Broadcom's
networking business unit.  (Reuters/San Jose Mercury News 16 Aug 99)

SBC TO OFFER E-MAIL-ONLY PHONE SERVICE  [Not only SBC. . .so news says]
SBC Communications plans a September launch for its new eMessage service --
designed for people who want to communicate online, but don't want to use a
computer to do it.  The service will use a portable phone attachment that
includes a keyboard and screen.  The e-mail-only service marks the first
time a major phone company has offered a service geared especially toward
the "Internet appliance" market.  The eMessage service will cost about $10 a
month, and the device will sell for about $180 - about half the price of Web
phones.  (Los Angeles Times 19 Aug 99)

NET ENEMIES LIST
Reporters Sans Frontiers, a Paris-based organization that promotes press
freedom, has compiled a Top-20 list of countries that severely restrict
citizens' access to information on the Internet.  They are: Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Burma, China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Libya, North
Korea, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia,
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.  Most of the countries named have
state-owned Internet service providers that filter and censor Web sites for
their citizens, and more repressive regimes, like Burma's, require computer
owners to register with the government.  A few, like North Korea and Iraq,
have almost no Internet access at all.  And in Saudi Arabia, the Internet is
viewed as "a harmful force for Westernizing people's minds."  (Investor's

INSTANT MESSAGING
Prodigy, Tribal Voice and PeopleLink have agreed to give their customers the
ability to instantly exchange notes with the 1.3 million users of the
Microsoft Network's instant message service. This accommodation with
Microsoft is in stark contrast to the position taken by America Online,
which has repeatedly counterattacked Microsoft's attempt to link its own
service with AOL's to allow instant communication between Microsoft and AOL
customers.  (San Jose Mercury News 18 Aug 99)

JUDGE NIXES AOL TRADEMARK ATTEMPT
A federal judge has rejected America Online's attempt to prohibit AT&T from
using the terms "You have mail," "Buddy List," and "IM" on its WorldNet
service.  AOL had claimed that the words and phrases were trademarked.
"We're pleased the court agreed that these terms are in the public domain -
available for all to use," says AT&T General Counsel Jim Cicconi.  "AOL's
claim that it owns the everyday language of the Internet is another example
of AOL's attempt to monopolize all aspects of services over the Internet."
AOL says it will appeal the ruling and its general counsel is "confident
that the ruling will be reversed."  (Bloomberg News/Los Angeles Times 17

PRIVACY ADVOCATES COMPLAIN ABOUT AMAZON'S "FUN FEATURE"
Amazon.com says its new "Purchase Circle" feature is "a fun way for people
to find out what others are buying yet maintain individual confidentiality,"
but privacy advocates think it's a step in the wrong direction.  The feature
allows people to see what the most popular books are among Amazon patrons at
any large organization;  for example, "Memories of a Geisha" is now No. 1 at
Charles Schwab, and "The End of Marketing As We Know It" at CocaCola. Web
design expert Jacob Nielsen says, "From a privacy perspective, it's very
scary.  It's a true Big Brother phenomenon." The feature can not be used to
learn what individuals are reading;  the company only makes public reading
profiles of groups that include at least several hundred individuals. [No
inferences are drawn from the popularity of particular books at particular
institutions.] David Sobel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center
says, "People don't like the idea that their purchases are being turned into
profiles, and they certainly don't like the idea that information is turned
over to third parties, even it it's not personally identifiable."  (USA

ICANN AGAIN REJECTS REQUEST FOR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERSHIPS
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has for the
second time rejected a request for representation by a number of persons who
own Internet domain names as individuals rather than as corporations or
other organizations. ICANN, now meeting in Chile, has been accused of
letting its decision-making activities be biased in the interests of large
organizations that can afford to send their representatives all over the
world. (New York Times Cybertimes 26 Aug 99)

FORTY MOVIES ON A SINGLE DISK
Japan's Science & Technology Agency and Sharp Corp. have developed a 12-inch

equivalent of 40 two-hour movies. The new disk and disk drive will not be
available commercially for at least three years.  (San Jose Mercury News 26

AOL LAUNCHES FREE UK INTERNET SERVICE
In an effort to squelch upstart British rival Freeserve, America Online has
launched its own subscription-free service in the U.K.  Freeserve's free
Internet access model has been copied by about 200 other service providers
in the U.K. over the last year, causing British consumers to lose interest
in subscription-based ISPs. In a further attempt to clone the Freeserve
model, AOL Europe has linked with retail giant Kingfisher to distribute the
free service. Freeserve uses parent company Dixons' outlets to sell its
software. (Financial Times 25 Aug 99)

Requests

Some time ago, after a request made by Michael Hart, a few volunteers
helped posting on PG the Spanish literature masterwork Don Quijote de la
Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes. I think that this could be a good opportunity
to continue posting etexts in Spanish but we need help from people wanting
to volunteer. I do not have much time to dedicate to the effort alone, so I
ask anyone wanting to help to contribute to contact Michael or myself in
order to create a "stable" group (like the one that does German etexts, for
example) on Spanish texts. Basically what we need is someone who has time
enough to become a "leader" of the team (I can help a little if needed),
proofers (to check scanned or already digitized texts) and/or searchers
for copyright matters.  We would appreciate any help on this.

NEW HANDHELD COMPUTER TO COMPETE AGAINST PALMPILOT
The creators of the PalmPilot handheld computer, who left their former
company to form a new one called Handspring, are about to compete against
the PalmPilot. Called "Visor," their new device will be sold in modular
versions starting at $149 and will be aimed at both the consumer and office
markets. Various modules will enable the Visor to work as a digital camera,
music player, pager, and wireless telephone. (Reuters/New York Times 10 Sep 99)

BRITISH TELECOM OFFERS FREE PCs
British Telecom has become the first U.K. Internet service provider to offer
customers a free personal computer as part of its BT Internet PC package.
The package, which costs 25.99 British pounds a month, also includes
installation, training, and free weekend ISP connections. At the end of
three years, customers will own their Fujitsu PC. BT says its new service
will cost less than 90p a day, and noted that the free weekend connections
would eliminate the potential problem of children running up phone bills
during peak Internet usage times.  (Associated Newspapers Ltd. 14 Sep 99)

WRITERS WIN INTERNET COPYRIGHT SUIT IN CHINA
In the first case of its kind in China, a group of six prominent writers has
been awarded compensatory damages for having their work published without
their permission. The court ruled that Century Internet Communications
Technology Co. had violated the writers' copyrights by putting their works
on Beijing Online's Web site.  The writers will receive anywhere from 720
yuan ($87) to 12,380 yuan (about $1,480) each. (Reuters/San Jose Mercury

FREELANCERS' PERMISSION NEEDED TO POST ELECTRONICALLY
A federal appeals-court panel has ruled that publishers must receive
permission from freelance writers, musicians, photographers and artists
before putting their material online or onto CD-ROMs, and must pay them
extra compensation for the privilege unless otherwise contractually
negotiated. The original suit was filed in 1993 by six writers who accused
several media companies, including the New York Times, Time Warner's Sports
Illustrated, Times Mirror's Newsday, and Reed-Elsevier's Lexis/Nexis
database, of copyright infringement for reproducing their work online
without permission. A federal court judge in 1997 sided with the publishers,
saying that electronic databases are simply revised versions of original
publications and that copyright law doesn't require extra payment by
publishers. The appeals-court panel on Friday found that databases differ
significantly because they contain thousands or millions of individual
articles that can be retrieved without reference to the original
publication. Most media companies today require "all rights" contracts,
which explicitly include electronic reproduction, but the real problem for
media organizations, says attorney Bruce Keller, is what should be done
about articles written during the 20 years prior to this case.

PHONES OUTNUMBER UMBRELLAS IN LOST-AND-FOUND
Londoners are leaving up to 45 mobile phones on buses and trains every day
-- outnumbering the number of umbrellas left behind for the first time ever.
According to Maureen Beaumont, manager of London Transport's lost property
office, the number of handsets being turned in is up sharply: "It's just
creeping up and up and up. It was just 30 a day a couple of months ago. Now
we're up to 40 or 45 a day." This year so far, there are 4,000 abandoned
phones waiting to be claimed, but because many users have insurance policies
that replace their phones within a few days, most of the misplaced handsets
are just left in the lost property office for the requisite six months.
"After that we can sell them as a piece of hardware -- we just dispose of
the sim card," says Beaumont. (Financial Times 27 Sep 99)

WIRED CITIES
An Ohio State University study has identified the 20 "most
Internet-accessible" U.S. cities: 1, Washington, DC; 2, Chicago; 3, Dallas;
4, New York; 5, Atlanta; 6, San Jose; 7, Los Angeles; 8, Houston; 9, San
Francisco; 10, Phoenix; 11, Boston; 12, Seattle; 13, Philadelphia; 14, St.
Louis; 15, Denver; 16, Baltimore; 17, Minneapolis; 18, Palo Alto; 19,
Detroit; 20, Santa Clara. The authors say, "In general, cities with more
linkages to the Internet backbone will have faster access and more reliable
connections to global information. This enhanced access results in a
comparative advantage that will grow in importance with the continuing
computerization of information." (Newsbytes News Network/USA Today 24 Sep 99)

MICROSOFT'S IE5 REELING AGAIN AFTER TWO NEW BUGS DISCOVERED
Experts this week found two new security bugs that affect
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5 (IE5) browser.  Security expert
Georgi Guninski discovered one spoofing glitch that would give
hackers access to data on IE5 even through a firewall.  The bug
would allow an HTML JavaScript to activate once a user visits a
Web site, and then download files back to the user's computer.
Since the files are downloaded from the computer back to itself
rather than to another machine, firewalls do not prevent the
attack.  After the information has been downloaded back to the
original computer, it can be sent to any IP address.  Microsoft
is now working on a patch, and suggests in the meantime that
concerned users disable IE5's active scripting.  A second bug,
confirmed this week by BugNet and its parent company KeyLabs,
would allow IE5's rendering engine to alter HTML tags.  HTML tags
could change when users working with IE5 and Microsoft's MSHTML
editing and rendering engine use the "Web Page, complete" default
setting.  Microsoft is working to repair the problem, and
suggests for now that users rely on the "Web Page, HTML only"
setting.  (InfoWorld Electric 09/29/99)

STUDY: HIGH COST FOR WINDOWS 2000 TRANSITION
The migration costs of Microsoft's Windows 2000 are so high that
companies implementing the operating system would be unlikely to
see a return on investment for at least three years, according to
a recent Gartner Group study.  The report indicates that the
migration cost for Windows 2000 could amount to as much as $3,100
per PC.  Gartner vice president Michael Gartenberg says by the
time a company would see a return on Windows 2000, it would be
time to switch to another operating system.  Microsoft has
advertised Windows 2000 as offering "increased reliability,
availability, and scalability with end-to-end management features
that reduce operating costs."  Microsoft studies indicate
companies migrating to Windows 2000 will see benefits
immediately.  Microsoft concedes that migration can be expensive,
but says Windows 2000 can significantly reduce operating costs by
streamlining help-desk operations, improving PC manageability,
and offering businesses greater control over software
applications.  (C|Net 09/09/99)

CUT IN FIBER CABLE DISRUPTS INTERNET TRAFFIC NATIONWIDE
Internet traffic throughout the country was slowed dramatically
yesterday after a fiber cable was cut.  A gas company in Ohio
inadvertently cut the cable with a backhoe at about noon
yesterday.  Traffic between the East and West Coasts was as much
as 50 times slower than usual.  Some companies experienced so
much trouble that they had no choice but to close down.  Although
fiber cuts occur occasionally, a cut to such a large cable is
unusual, according to Bill Woodcock, a network architect for
regional ISP Zocalo.  The cable was transmitting 40 billion bits
per second.  Traffic that would usually move through the cable
was rerouted, but the congestion that resulted slowed data moving
through other network segments.  GTE, which owned segments of the
cut cable, said last night that the cable would probably be fixed
by 9 p.m.  (New York Times 09/30/99)

EXPERTS FEAR AN OUTBREAK OF Y2K VIRUSES
Computer security experts are concerned about a possible outbreak
of Y2K viruses after two Y2K-related viruses appeared last week.
Experts say Y2K hoaxes, viruses that are spread via
Y2K-remediation software, and viruses designed to first appear on
January 1, 2000, are among the dangers associated with the
beginning of the new millennium.  A new "Trojan Horse" virus
appeared last week in the guise of an e-mail offering a free year
2000 countdown clock.  Once activated, the virus enters the
computer's Internet connection to gain access to the user's
passwords and account numbers.  The other virus appearing last
week, called W32/Fix2001, arrives as a note from the "system
administrator" and claims to provide software for fixing a Y2K
Internet problem.  If launched, the virus will attach itself to
all future e-mail transmissions.  Although experts say both
viruses are not considered major threats, future viruses could
be.  (San Francisco Chronicle 09/20/99)

BRITISH PUBLISHER PUTS BOOKS ONLINE
Dorling Kindersley, a educational book and CD-ROM publisher, says it's
planning to put all of its material online, allowing customers to view
entire books online before they decide whether to purchase. The move signals
the bookseller's attempt to replicate the experience of shopping in a
bricks-and-mortar bookstore: "People want to be able to look inside books
just as they would in a store," says Alan Buckingham, managing director of
Dorling Kindersley Online. The company hopes to have 10% of its holdings
online by January. Executive Chairman Peter Kindersley acknowledges that
customers could print out the pages they need rather than buy the entire
text, but says that risk is small in comparison to the benefits of brand
awareness: "It is highly unlikely someone will print out a whole book
because the cost of printer cartridges is extremely high."

I just finished watching Biography's "100 Most Influential People of the
Millennium" and our dear Mr. Gutenberg was #1!!!   No question - good choice.
Thought you might like to know - on behalf of all us Gutenbergers!
From: Hoost0811@aol.com


"Just got the Nov. 8 issue of TIME Magazine today --- focused on the 21st
century.  And I was delighted to see Michael Hart profiled as a visionary
in People to Watch' on p. 14."  From Richard Seltzer   ["People To Watch"
is a new column in TIME, we made the top of their list, chosen as to lead
off what they hope will be a permanent feature.]


We should also be the cover story for the Chicago Tribune Sunday Supplement
on November 21st. . .this article has been in progress since March and they
say it should be the best one of these they have done in well over a year.
We shall see, eh?


Given that we are today releasing about 75 new Etexts, we are now approaching
being 10 months ahead of schedule. . .our current goal is to get to 12 months
. . .actually 12 1/2 months. . .ahead of schedule by the end of 2001, to have
3,333 Project Gutenberg Etexts online at that time. . .about 1/3 of that goal
we originally started with. . .but. . .that goal also included a prediction I
made that the other Etext producers would be happy to put their public domain
Etexts on our servers and help us do the appropriate copyright research.  The
truth is that one of the things we need is a liaison person to coordinate our
efforts with the handful of other major Etext producers so we can provide the
10,000 Etexts now available in a proper manner through our worldwide servers.
So, if you are the kind of person who can do this, please. . .let us know!!!

Comments About Our New Files

First a correction to an earlier comment:

I chose it because my goal was to change the way information is
passed from person to person as much as Johannes Gutenberg did.
He reduced the price of books to 1/400th of their previous cost
which was equal to that of the average family farm beforehand!!
Now you can buy a 25G hard drive for $300. . .and you **could**
put 5 thousand copies of the Complete Works of Shakespeare on a
drive like that, without compression. . .that's 6 cents a copy!
There are terabyte drive packs on the way, that will cost less,
and will hold just about every word in even a *large* library!!
It will not so many of these to hold the Library of Congress!!!
I have heard estimates from 2 to 20 terabytes. . .but when such
terabytes are as common as gigabytes are now. . .who will care?


Comments About Our New Files

We lead off this Newsletter Index with Uncle Remus, in honor of
the movie "Song of the South". . .which has been removed from a
circulating feature [I think by Disney] because of "politically
incorrect" catcalls from certain political action committees.

Millions of students saw this movie as "required viewing" in an
era before this kind of political pressure, but which had an
entirely different "politically incorrect" venue known as:

"The McCarthy Era Witch Hunts"

which didn't seem to be have the kind of power now wielded by a
wide range of groups who could be called politically incorrect,
themselves.  Rewriting history, particularly history that was a
"staple" in our educational system, is totally incorrect.  I do
understand that in any history there are events and values that
should not be passed on but neither should they be passed over.
By pretending these things never happened we do NOT encourage a
proper perspective, either by these committees, or on the parts
of the people more directly involved.


Meanwhile, our German Team continues to amaze me. . . .

Several more additions are listed below, and more on the way!!

I hope they are an inspiration to those considering helping us
do Etexts in other languages. . .it took us forever to get the
German Team rolling, and now. . .fantastic. . .please help get
us rolling with other languages!!!

FCC CHAIR TO WORLDCOM:  NOT SO FAST THERE
A statement by Federal Communications Commission chairman William E. Kennard
indicates that MCI WorldCom may have some difficulty getting FCC approval of
its $129-billion acquisition of Sprint:  "Competition has produced a price
war in the long-distance market. This merger appears to be a surrender. How
can this be good for customers? The parties will bear a heavy burden to show
how consumers would be better off." (Washington Post 6 Oct 99)

The Vergil group, one of several "collective self-study" Latin groups
on latin@lists.colorado.edu,  is currently translating the *Aeneid*
from Latin into English at the rate of 30-35 lines a week, using the PG text.
Participants translate each week's assignments, and then have the opportunity
to compare their translations with other participants' work.  For more

DECEMBER 1999


This is Project Gutenberg's Newsletter for Thursday, December 19, 1998

[Usually sent the first Wednesday of each month, delayed if by relay.]
Main URL is promo.net    Webmaster is Pietro di Miceli, of Rome, Italy

We have the 36 Etext for May, 1999 pretty much ready for you, and some
new Shakespeare files, though BEWARE!. . .the filenames or numbers may
change over the next month or so. . .I haven't quite yet figured out a
whole strategy for working with what the mice played with while I went
on vacation. . .a vacation I am certainly glad to be back from.  It is
odd to say, but everything when pretty much the opposite as expected--
I had a great time in LA accepting the WIRED 25 "Oscar" on behalf of a
thousand Project Gutenberg volunteers, and did all I was asked to do &
and bit more at the party. . .[I was indeed the "life of the party."]

As I often try to do, we have managed some new Shakespeare to honor my
father, who died 9 years ago today, and for whom I try to do some work
on this day each year, as well as to light a candle for him.  I have a
GREAT BIG THANK YOU to our Shakespeare Team for getting this ready for
today, you will see THOUSANDS of corrections in these new files!!!  My
father was a great Shakespeare professor, who instilled in me and many
others a great feeling for the classics, in literature, music and art.

This one's for you, Dad!

A note from our US Director of Production, Dianne Bean:

Working on a reasonable-sized-print book, water damaged at the bottom:
Testing Omnipage 9 on it and there's a HUGE difference between this and
Textbridge--they improved the OCR so it's better by a mile than
Textbridge, no longer even close...I'm only picking up 1 or 2 errors on a
page; where the pages are a little warped at the bottom, TB was making an
awful garble, but OP sails right through! And it hasn't crashed yet.

I will be meeting with Lawrence Lessig of Harvard, who apparently is the
one the Supreme Court of the US chose to teach them about computers, and
about the Internet.  We will be planning the lawsuit to challenge all of
the new copyright extensions we tried so hard to keep from becoming law.
He has asked for some serious volunteers who would also like to sue; the
cases are more secure when there are several plaintiffs, not just one.

Just email me if you are interested.  I meet with him Monday.  We should
also like to receive any points you would like included in the suit, and
we would like these whether or not you are willing to be a plaintiff.

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
